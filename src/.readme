To run this in IntelliJ:
Run - Edit Configurations - Add Tomcat LocalHost
Under Deployments tab of Tomcat, add an exploded war of the project
Select the run browser as Chrome
Once this is done, Run Localhost. It should open up browser page with Browse button to upload file.
Currently the project is set up that a file gets stored in E://INSE. This is set up in UploadController.java
The folder has to exist, for the file to be saved there.
NOTE : Currently the file name as to be Data Sample 2.2.xlsx
This will later be changed to be configured in a properties file.
